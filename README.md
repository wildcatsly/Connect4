Connect 4 Project
=========================

See the [Getting Started](https://github.com/eecs183/Connect4/wiki/Getting-Started) guide for more information.
I believe my AI will beats your hard AI. So our team choose to beats all your AI from Easy to Hard.
    Paragraph describing the functionality of my algorithm in ai:For the AI of connect4, we applied Minimax theory and in order to reach that goal, we involved some concepts and methods which beyond the scope of our class during the coding. Concepts such as vector and pair and algorithm such as Iterative approaches and so on. The AI is so powerful that you can only win it by setting a trap during the opening  , a chess terminology " Force To win". 
    All the functions' RME are attached below:
